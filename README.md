# Python-Learning
Our analysis use two datasets: one containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play, and another containing about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store. You can download the datasets directly from:

Android apps: https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv

iOS apps: https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv

Utilizing these available data allows us to save a huge amount of time and cost. While exploring those data, we can evaluate our codes before applying to our real dataset. Let's start by opening these data sets and explore them.
